　　youth comes only once in a lifetime, therefore, it is important that we should not waste those years in idleness and bad living. this is also the time when our memories are best. we are able to learn more during this time than when we become older. during our younger years, we have the enthusiasm to set high goals for ourselves. we also try to overcome obstacles which are placed in our way.
　　if we realize how precious youth is, we will be fulfilled when we are young as well as when we are older. if we waste our youth, we will spend the rest of our lives wishing we could be young again.
